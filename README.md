## Philosophy

We come across multiple project dependency in doing one project. So, we need to switch among dependent projects and its becomes heectic to change workspace or remember your workspace path. 

So the goal of this project is to minimize the process of change workspaces with tab's autocomplete or remembering project path. Meanwhile it gives you the flexibility to instantly switch among your dependent project/directory and do the necessary staff in your terminal.
